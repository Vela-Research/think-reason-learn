# Reasoning Forest ðŸŒ²

Reasoning Forest is an open-source Python library for building interpretable, tree/forest-style decision-making systems powered by large language models (LLMs).

## Installation

```bash
pip install reasoning-forest
```

## Quick Start

```python
from reasoning_forest.gptree import GPTree

tree = GPTree(...)
result = await tree.predict(...)
```
