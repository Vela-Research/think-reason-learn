About
=====

Think Reason Learn is an innovative, open-source Python library that fuses the power of large language models (LLMs) 
with interpretable machine learning. Developed at Vela Research in collaboration with Oxford University, it provides 
production-grade tools for building transparent decision-making systemsâ€”perfect for high-stakes domains like 
venture capital, healthcare, law, etc.

Key Features
------------

- **Explainable AI**: Every prediction comes with traceable reasoning paths, rules, or cluster descriptions.
- **Async-First Design**: Scalable LLM interactions with synchronous wrappers for flexibility.
- **Modular Algorithms**: Easily extend with new models under a unified interface.

Core Algorithms
---------------

- **GPTree**: LLM-guided decision trees for dynamic feature generation.
- **GPT-HTree**: Hierarchical clustering + localized trees with human-readable personas.
- **RRF (Random Rule Forest)**: Transparent ensembles of LLM-generated YES/NO rules.
