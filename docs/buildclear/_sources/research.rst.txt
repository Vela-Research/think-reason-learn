Research
========

Think Reason Learn is the culmination of cutting-edge research spearheaded by 
Vela Research in close collaboration with Oxford University. This project 
integrates advanced AI techniques with interpretable machine learning to 
create transparent, high-performance models for complex classification tasks.
